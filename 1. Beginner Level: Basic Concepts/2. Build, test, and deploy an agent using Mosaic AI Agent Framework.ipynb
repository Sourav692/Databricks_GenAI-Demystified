    "# Building Your First AI Agent with Databricks Mosaic AI: A Complete Guide\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive walkthrough of building, testing, and deploying a production-ready AI agent using Databricks' Mosaic AI Agent Framework! Whether you're a data engineer, ML practitioner, or solution architect working with Databricks, this guide will take you through every step of creating an intelligent agent that can interact with users and execute code to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build an agent that:\n",
    "- Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) served on Databricks Foundation Model API\n",
    "- Can execute Python code dynamically to solve computational problems\n",
    "- Is fully deployable as a production endpoint\n",
    "- Integrates seamlessly with MLflow for tracking and versioning\n",

    "### Cell 1: Installing Required Dependencies\n",

    "%pip install -U -qqqq mlflow databricks-openai databricks-agents\n",

    "\n",
    "**What's happening here?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell installs three critical Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`mlflow`**: The open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. We'll use this to log, version, and deploy our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`databricks-openai`**: A specialized SDK that provides an OpenAI-compatible interface for interacting with Databricks model serving endpoints. This allows us to use familiar OpenAI-style APIs while leveraging Databricks' infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`databricks-agents`**: The core framework for building and deploying agents on Databricks, providing tools for agent orchestration and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-U` flag ensures we get the latest versions, and `-qqqq` suppresses verbose installation output for a cleaner notebook experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why restart Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dbutils.library.restartPython()` command is crucial—it restarts the Python interpreter to ensure all newly installed packages are properly loaded into the notebook's runtime environment. This prevents import errors and version conflicts.\n",

    "\n",
    "This elegant function performs a \"health check\" on an LLM endpoint by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a WorkspaceClient**: This establishes a connection to your Databricks workspace with automatic authentication\n",
    "2. **Getting an OpenAI client**: Retrieves a client configured to communicate with Databricks serving endpoints\n",
    "3. **Sending a test query**: Makes a simple chat completion request with \"What is AI?\" to verify the endpoint responds\n",
    "4. **Returning True/False**: If the request succeeds, the endpoint is available; any exception means it's not\n",
    "\n",
    "**The smart fallback mechanism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code iterates through a list of candidate LLM endpoints:\n",
    "- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Anthropic's powerful model known for following instructions precisely\n",
    "- **Meta Llama 3.3 70B Instruct**: Meta's open-source instruction-tuned model\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures your notebook works across different Databricks workspace configurations. If your workspace doesn't have Claude available, it automatically falls back to Llama 3.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The assertion at the end** guarantees that we have a working endpoint before proceeding—failing fast if no LLM is available.\n",

    "- **Parameter passing**: The function receives parameters as a dictionary and forwards them to the Unity Catalog function executor\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Raises a clear error if an unknown tool is requested\n",

    "A list of messages representing the conversation flow—this could be just the LLM's direct answer, or an LLM response + tool call + tool result sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important limitation:**\n",
    "This implementation handles only **one tool call** per prompt (note `tool_calls[0]`). For production agents, you'd want to loop through multiple tool calls and potentially allow multi-turn conversations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Modularity is Key\n",
    "The code cleanly separates concerns:\n",
    "- Tool definitions\n",
    "- Agent orchestration\n",
    "- MLflow integration\n",
    "- Deployment configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MLflow Autologging\n",
    "Always enable `mlflow.openai.autolog()` for production agents—the observability is invaluable for debugging and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Resource Declaration\n",
    "Explicitly declaring Databricks resources ensures:\n",
    "- Automatic authentication\n",
    "- Clear dependency tracking\n",
    "- Proper governance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Dynamic Endpoint Selection\n",
    "The fallback mechanism for LLM endpoints makes your code robust across different workspace configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Standardized Interfaces\n",
    "Using MLflow's `ChatAgent` interface ensures compatibility with Databricks' agent ecosystem and UIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production Enhancements to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "While this quickstart is excellent for learning, here are enhancements for production:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Multi-turn Conversations\n",
    "Currently, the agent processes single prompts. Add conversation memory:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def run_agent(messages_history):  # Accept full history\n",
    "    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "        model=LLM_ENDPOINT_NAME,\n",
    "        messages=messages_history,  # Use full context\n",
    "        tools=builtin_tools,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Tool Calls\n",
    "Handle scenarios where the LLM makes multiple tool calls:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if msg.tool_calls:\n",
    "    for call in msg.tool_calls:  # Loop through all calls\n",
    "        tool_result = call_tool(call.function.name, ...)\n",
    "        # Append each result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Error Handling\n",
    "Add robust error handling for tool execution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    tool_result = call_tool(...)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Return error message to LLM for recovery\n",
    "    tool_result = f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Tools\n",
    "Extend beyond Python execution:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "builtin_tools = UCFunctionToolkit(\n",
    "    function_names=[\n",
    "        \"system.ai.python_exec\",\n",
    "        \"catalog.schema.custom_search_tool\",\n",
    "        \"catalog.schema.data_retrieval_tool\",\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    client=client\n",
    ").tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Add system prompts for better behavior:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful data analysis assistant...\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Streaming Responses\n",
    "For better user experience, implement streaming:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=LLM_ENDPOINT_NAME,\n",
    "    messages=messages,\n",
    "    tools=builtin_tools,\n",
    "    stream=True,  # Enable streaming\n",
