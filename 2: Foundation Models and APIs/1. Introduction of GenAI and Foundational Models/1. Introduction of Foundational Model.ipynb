    "\n",
    "3. **Create Endpoints:**\n",
    "   - Use unified API or UI\n",
    "   - Configure appropriate serving type (pay-per-token or provisioned)\n",
    "   - Set up governance and access controls\n",
    "   - Test with sample queries\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integrate and Deploy:**\n",
    "   - Use OpenAI-compatible SDK\n",
    "   - Implement error handling and retries\n",
